# Machine Learning Project: Predicting Olympic Medal Counts

## Overview

This project demonstrates the full process of building a machine learning model to predict the number of Olympic medals a country will win. The guide walks through all the key stages—from hypothesis formulation to model evaluation—offering a clear path for developing and deploying an end-to-end machine learning solution using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

We'll be using historical Olympic data to drive this prediction. The aim is to apply various machine learning techniques to uncover patterns from past events and leverage them to forecast medal counts based on both historical and current variables.

## Project Workflow

This project follows a structured approach, which mirrors best practices in machine learning development. Here's the outline we'll adhere to:

### 1. Formulate a Hypothesis

- The first step is to define a clear hypothesis: in this case, predicting how many medals a country will win in a given Olympic event based on historical data such as past performances, GDP, population, and other influencing factors.

### 2. Data Collection and Exploration

- Gather and explore relevant datasets to understand the key variables. The exploration will help in identifying trends, distributions, and relationships that are crucial for making accurate predictions.

### 3. Data Reshaping (if needed)

- Depending on the dataset structure, you may need to reshape or aggregate the data (e.g., transforming individual athlete-level data into a team-level dataset) to align with your prediction goals.

### 4. Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Properly prepare the data for modeling by handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing or encoding features. This step ensures your dataset is clean and ready for the machine learning algorithms to interpret effectively.

### 5. Select an Error Metric

- Choose the most appropriate metric to evaluate the model’s performance, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or another metric suited to regression problems.

### 6. Split the Data

- Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure the model's performance can be properly evaluated on unseen data.

### 7. Model Training and Evaluation

- Train a machine learning model using your prepared data and evaluate its performance on the test set. Experiment with different algorithms and fine-tune hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
